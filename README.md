# Project Setup 

### 1. Clone the repository
Clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vedesh-padal/tal-chat-web.git
cd tal-chat-web
```

### 2. Choosing a Module

Since the project is now just ready with backend API support, the working directory is now `backend`. Change to the backend directory using `cd backend`.


### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Instructions for `backend` directory:

1. Create a copy of `.env.sample` file and rename it to `.env`
2. Put the MongoDB connection URL (either from MongoDB Atlas, or local Docker setup MongoDB URL) in the `MONGODB_URI` key value in `.env` file.
3. Obtain a RESEND (mailing service provider) API key from [here](https://resend.com/api-keys), and put the API key into `RESEND_API_KEY` key value in `.env` file.
4. Feel free to change the `env` variables: `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`, `REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET` and others except `NODE_ENV` according to your usecase.

#### Starting the Backend service:
5. Run the following command to start the Backend:
    (assuming that you are in the `backend` directory)
      ```bash
      cd src
      npm start
      ```

- Once, the backend is started, head over to the `BACKEND_HOST_URL` URL that was given in `. env` file to take a look at the OpenAPI Spec (Swagger Docs).

- If you have not changed the `BACKEND_HOST_URL`, click on the following [link](http://localhost:8081) to access Swagger Docs of this project.

- Since the database is just created, you need to create users and perform other operations.
For that, please visit Swagger Docs at your backend URL to understand the routes and test the backend.
